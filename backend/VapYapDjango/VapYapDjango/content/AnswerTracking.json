Transitioning to cleaner energy sources, promoting sustainable transportation options, and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can all work towards both mitigating climate change and improving air quality. By tackling climate change, we can also positively impact air pollution levels, leading to a healthier environment for everyone.",

Climate change contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, leading to an increase in heatwaves as more ultraviolet radiation from the sun reaches the Earth's surface. The ozone layer acts as a shield, protecting us from harmful UV rays. As it weakens, heatwaves become more frequent and intense, posing a threat to human health and the environment. It is imperative that we take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the ozone layer to mitigate the impacts of climate change and prevent further escalation of heatwaves.\n\nIf there are no developments on the mitigation of ozone layer depletion by lessening greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves caused by the ozone effect will persist. Though efforts may be made to adapt to the changing climate, the long-term solution lies in addressing the root causes of climate change.",
