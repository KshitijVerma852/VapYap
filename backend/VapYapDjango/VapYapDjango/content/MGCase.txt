Ladies and Gentlemen, today as the Member of Government, I stand before you to extend the debate beyond our national borders and examine the profound international implications of offering amnesty to whistleblowers who expose unethical practices in government. Allow me to expound on why this policy strengthens international relations, enhances global standing, and supports broader diplomatic efforts related to transparency and human rights.

**1. Aligning with International Norms and Practices:**
Globally, there is an increasing trend towards transparency and the protection of those who expose wrongdoing. International bodies, including the United Nations and the European Union, have repeatedly emphasized the importance of safeguarding whistleblowers to uphold human rights and combat corruption. By granting amnesty, democratic states not only align themselves with these international norms but also set a benchmark for others. This alignment is crucial, as it fosters a united front in global governance standards, reinforcing the international legal frameworks that advocate for transparency and accountability.

Justification: Alignment with international norms fosters consistency and predictability in diplomatic relations. It decreases tension and conflicts arising from differing national standards, particularly concerning human rights and corruption, thereby smoothing interactions on a global stage.

**2. Enhancing Diplomatic Relations and Global Standing:**
A state's reputation on the global stage is paramount. By granting amnesty to whistleblowers, democratic states project themselves as bastions of moral integrity and transparency. This projection is not merely symbolic but operational, as it influences bilateral and multilateral relations. States known for protecting whistleblowers and promoting transparency are more likely to attract alliances, partnerships, and cooperative agreements, especially with those who share or aspire to similar values.

Justification: Diplomatic relations often hinge on trust and mutual values. States with robust whistleblower protections are viewed as trustworthy and less likely to harbor hidden unethical practices that could later strain alliances or lead to diplomatic embarrassments.

**3. Strengthening Mechanisms for Handling Sensitive Information:**
Contrary to the Opposition's claims that granting amnesty might compromise national security, this policy can lead to the opposite. By openly addressing and rectifying internal unethical practices, states can strengthen their mechanisms for handling sensitive information. This process does not only improve internal security protocols but also enhances international security cooperation by setting high standards of information management and transparency.

Justification: Effective handling of whistleblowers can lead to improved internal review processes and oversight mechanisms, ensuring that sensitive information is protected and that unethical practices are swiftly addressed before escalating into larger issues that might compromise national and international security.

**4. Encouraging Responsible Whistleblowing Globally:**
By setting a precedent of amnesty, democratic states encourage responsible whistleblowing not only within their borders but also globally. This move counters the Oppositionâ€™s fear of reckless leaking of information. Instead, it establishes a structured and safe framework for whistleblowing, which dissuades individuals from resorting to potentially harmful methods of disclosure, such as unauthorized leaks to foreign entities or media outbursts without prior internal address.

Justification: Responsible whistleblowing, supported by the safety net of amnesty, encourages individuals to follow due processes which typically involve internal channels before public disclosures. This method reduces the risks associated with uncontrolled disclosures and fosters a culture of ethical vigilance.

In conclusion, the international benefits of granting amnesty to whistleblowers are clear and manifold. This policy not only consolidates democratic integrity at home but also projects it globally, enhancing diplomatic ties, aligning with international practices, and securing a stronger position in the global order. These reasons, therefore, mandate a firm vote in favor of granting amnesty, recognizing its broad and impactful international dimensions.
