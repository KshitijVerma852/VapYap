Ladies and gentlemen, we on the side of the government affirm that democratic states should grant an amnesty to whistleblowers who expose unethical practices in the government. We enhance the established narrative by focusing particularly on the international implications and strategic importance of such a policy, thereby fulfilling a critical gap and presenting a more comprehensive argument.

Our extension today revolves around two major ways in which granting amnesty to whistleblowers holds crucial international significance: firstly, by fostering international relations through strengthened global transparency norms and, secondly, by encouraging a domino effect where other nations are influenced to adopt similar ethical practices in governance.

**1. Enhancing International Relations through Global Transparency Standards:**
Democratic states are often leaders in establishing norms that later become global standards. By granting amnesty to whistleblowers, they signal to the international community a strong commitment to transparency and accountability. This is of immense importance for several reasons:

- **Trust Building:** Transparency builds trust not only internally among the citizenry but also externally in international forums. Governments that are seen as open and accountable are more likely to garner respect and leverage in international diplomacy. This trust is foundational for forming robust international coalitions and partnerships, crucial in combating global issues like terrorism, climate change, and pandemics.

- **Setting a Precedent:** Many smaller or less influential nations often look up to larger democratic states for policy direction. By implementing laws that protect whistleblowers through amnesty, democratic states set a behavioral norm that encourages ethical governance internationally. This not only helps in spreading democratic norms but also stabilizes regions by encouraging governments to act transparently and justly.

**2. Fostering a Global Culture of Ethical Governance:**
When a democratic state grants amnesty to whistleblowers, it initiates a ripple effect across the globe:

- **Modeling Behavior:** By acting as role models, these states show that ethical governance and protection of truth-tellers is achievable and desirable. This modeling behavior is crucial because it helps to establish international benchmarks for governance that other countries could aspire to reach.

- **Empowerment and Protection of Individuals:** The policy empowers individuals in other nations to come forth with information about unethical practices without the fear of retribution. Knowing that such policies are receiving international support and recognition, even potential whistleblowers in less democratic regimes may find both the courage and the necessary support required to expose corrupt practices.

In contrast, failing to provide amnesty limits the potential positive influences described. Without it, whistleblowers face significant personal risks, including legal actions and social stigma, which may deter them from coming forward. This leads to a muted impact on unethical practices within governments and a slow degradation of global trust in democratic institutions. Moreover, international relations remain fraught, as states cannot collaborate effectively if they mistrust each other's internal practices and governance standards.

This policy, therefore, does not only serve an internal function but also plays a crucial role in international relations. By promoting transparency, protecting whistleblowers and fostering a global culture of ethical governance, we not only reinforce democracy at home but strengthen and encourage its principles around the world. This broader perspective clarifies the substantial and far-reaching impacts of the policy, making it not only a national necessity but a global imperative.

By focusing on both the national and international benefits of granting amnesty to whistleblowers, this policy proposal stands robust against criticisms, especially those which might argue the risks of misuse of whistleblower protections. The international benefits particularly provide a global safety net that encourages ethical disclosures, ultimately leading to a more transparent, accountable, and effective governance system worldwide.
