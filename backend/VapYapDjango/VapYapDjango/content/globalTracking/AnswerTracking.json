As global temperatures rise, the ozone layer becomes destabilized, leading to the trapping of heat and ultimately, the occurrence of more frequent and intense heatwaves. This highlights the urgent need to address climate change and implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nIf that answer doesn't fully satisfy the argument, a mitigating justification could be: \"While the link between climate change and heatwaves is complex and multifaceted, it is important to take into consideration various factors contributing to heatwaves, such as urban heat island effect, land use changes, and atmospheric circulation patterns. While climate change plays a significant role, it is essential to address all these factors collectively to effectively mitigate the impact of heatwaves.\"",

For example, transitioning to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power can help mitigate both climate change and air pollution. Therefore, tackling climate change can actually have positive impacts on air quality in the long run.\n\nIf an answer cannot be provided, a justification to partially address the argument could be: While climate change can exacerbate air pollution, it is just one of many factors that contribute to poor air quality. Addressing air pollution requires a multifaceted approach that includes reducing emissions from vehicles and industries, improving energy efficiency, and implementing stricter environmental regulations. By focusing on specific actions to reduce air pollution, we can work towards improving air quality regardless of the impacts of climate change.",
