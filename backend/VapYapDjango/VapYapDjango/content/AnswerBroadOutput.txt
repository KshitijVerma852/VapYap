Certainly! If the opposition argues that cats are better than dogs because they are independent and require less attention and maintenance, here's how you might respond using the styles mentioned:

1. **Weighing Answer**:
   *Justification*: It's true that cats are more independent and require less daily care than dogs, which might seem advantageous for some owners. However, this same independence can lead to a lack of bonding and emotional engagement with their owners, which dogs provide in abundance. Dogs actively seek out interactions and affection, helping to strengthen emotional bonds and providing significant mental health benefits to their owners, such as reduced stress and loneliness. Thus, while cats might be easier to manage, the emotional and psychological benefits dogs offer make them a better pet for those seeking companionship and active engagement.

2. **Direct Answer**:
   *Justification*: The argument that cats are better due to their independent nature overlooks significant benefits of pet ownership that go beyond mere convenience. Dogs, by demanding more attention, also provide more opportunities for physical activity through walks and play. This active involvement promotes a healthier lifestyle for their owners, contributing to physical health along with psychological well-being. The opponent's emphasis on convenience lacks deeper analysis of these crucial health benefits that dogs uniquely provide, making them not just pets but partners in enhancing one's quality of life.

These responses directly address the opponent's points, offering clear justifications and comparisons to demonstrate why dogs might indeed be the better choice for many individuals based on deeper emotional, psychological, and physical health benefits.
