### Potential Opponent Arguments and Answers

#### Opponent Argument: Cats are Lower Maintenance than Dogs
1. **Weighing Answer**: While it might be true that cats generally require less day-to-day maintenance than dogs, the emotional and physical health benefits provided by dogs far outweigh the convenience factor of cats. The active engagement and companionship provided by dogs encourage a healthier lifestyle, which is crucial in today's sedentary society.

2. **Direct Answer**: Low maintenance does not necessarily equate to fulfilling companionship. Dogs’ need for more attention and activity fosters greater emotional bonds with their owners, contributing to significant psychological well-being.

#### Opponent Argument: Cats are More Independent and Less Intrusive
1. **Weighing Answer**: Although independence in pets might be suited for individuals with very busy lifestyles, the intrinsic value of a pet is companionship. Dogs’ sociable nature and dependency make them more responsive and interactive companions than cats, which is central to the benefits they provide, such as reducing loneliness and depression.

2. **Direct Answer**: The independence of cats often translates to less interaction, which means they are less effective at providing emotional support. Dogs’ “intrusive” nature is precisely what allows them to notice and respond to human emotions, which is beneficial in emotional therapy and support.

#### Opponent Argument: Cats are Better for Small Living Spaces
1. **Weighing Answer**: While spatial considerations are valid, the adaptability of dogs to various living conditions (e.g., small breeds like Chihuahuas or pugs) and the overarching benefits of active companionship and security offer greater value. Moreover, modern living arrangements increasingly accommodate pet-friendly environments, which mitigates spatial limitations.

2. **Direct Answer**: Many dog breeds thrive in small spaces, and regular walks serve to adequately manage their energy levels. Therefore, the argument that cats are categorically better suited to small spaces doesn't hold universally true.

#### Opponent Argument: Cats Cause Fewer Allergies
1. **Weighing Answer**: While it's true that fewer people may be allergic to cats than dogs, the benefits of dog ownership, like enhanced physical health and greater emotional and community safety, outweigh the allergy consideration. Moreover, hypoallergenic dog breeds exist that mitigate this concern.

2. **Direct Answer**: The issue of allergies, while significant, can be addressed through the choice of hypoallergenic breeds and proper grooming and household maintenance, which allows the broader benefits of dog companionship to be enjoyed without undue health compromise.

By powering these weighing and direct answers with evidence and logical justifications, you ensure that the debate remains focused on the comparative benefits of dogs over cats, emphasizing the multifaceted roles dogs play in enhancing human life.
