Ladies and gentlemen, today we gather here to debate a matter close to the hearts of many pet lovers: whether dogs, in comparison to cats, can be considered better companions and additions to households. Let us delve into this discussion with clear metrics and compelling evidence.

First and foremost, let's define what metrics we're using today to measure "better." We're not just talking about personal preference. We're comparing their benefits in terms of companionship, health benefits, safety, and social and developmental impacts on humans.

Now, let's address the first aspect of our case: Companionship and Emotional Support. Dogs are inherently social animals, evolved to interact closely with humans. This deep-rooted pack mentality fosters a level of loyalty and emotional connection with their owners that cats typically do not exhibit. The direct result of this companionship is a highly supportive relationship, serving not just as pets, but as profound emotional anchors for many.

Turning to health benefits, numerous studies have demonstrated how owning dogs significantly reduces stress, anxiety, and depression in humans. Moreover, dog owners are generally more active, thanks to the need for regular walks—activities that inherently promote a healthier lifestyle. These are comparative benefits that cat ownership does not typically offer, notably because cats do not require the same level of physical engagement from their owners.

On the matter of safety and security, dogs have been partners in protection for thousands of years. From barking at strangers to guarding their homes, dogs actively enhance domestic security. This protective trait is something that most cats simply do not offer. Small wonder why phrases such as "guard dog" are pervasive and "guard cat" is not. 

Considering social interactions, walking a dog typically leads to increased interactions with other individuals, fostering community ties and reducing feelings of isolation. For the elderly or those living alone, this can be particularly important. Can we say the same for cats? Less likely, since cats do not require or often even enjoy such external social walks.

Furthermore, let’s not forget the invaluable roles dogs play as service animals. From guiding the visually impaired to providing assistance in therapy and rescue operations, dogs continuously prove their ability to be trained and to operate in sync with complex human needs and emotions. The adaptability and trainability of dogs in these roles are significantly more advanced than those seen in cats.

Now, to touch upon the diversity dogs offer. The sheer range of dog breeds available, each with specific traits, allows potential pet owners to choose a companion that truly fits their lifestyle. Whether it's a high-energy border collie for active individuals or a calm and stoic bulldog for more laid-back environments, the versatility in choosing a dog is unmatched by cats.

Ladies and gentlemen, when considering the overall benefits dogs bring into human lives—through emotional support, physical health benefits, security, social interaction, and versatility in roles—it becomes evident that dogs have a considerable edge over cats as the better companions for humans. This isn't about dismissing the value cats add to many lives, but about recognizing the unparalleled contributions of dogs in various key areas of human life. Thus, with these points established clearly, we affirm the motion: dogs are indeed better than cats.

Thank you.
