Ladies and gentlemen, today we are here to discuss the motion, "Does religion do more harm than good?" From the opening government side, we argue affirmatively that religion, on balance, causes more harm than good. Our stance is not an outright condemnation of personal faith or spirituality but rather an evaluation of organized religion’s broad impacts on society, both historically and contemporaneously.

**Defining Important Terms:**
For this debate, ‘religion’ refers to organized systems of beliefs involving a supernatural element that typically includes practices, rituals, and moral codes. 'Harm' is understood here as actions or policies that directly impede human well-being, societal progress, or result in conflict and division.

**Case Structure:**
Our argument centers around three main points: the promotion of social division, the impediment to progress, and the indoctrination and moral absolutism that religion often fosters.

**1. Promotion of Social Division:**
First, religion fundamentally segregates people. It categorizes the world into believers and non-believers, often preaching that salvation, moral truth, or spiritual enlightenment is exclusively accessible through adherence to its doctrines. This inherent exclusion can escalate into prejudice, discrimination, and even outright violence. Historical examples are abundant, from the Crusades to modern sectarian conflicts in the Middle East. Even in contemporary democratic societies, religion can underpin laws and social norms that marginalize minority groups, such as those from different faiths, the non-religious, or the LGBTQ+ community.

**2. Impediment to Progress:**
Secondly, religion often stands in opposition to scientific and cultural progress. Throughout history, religious institutions have resisted scientific discoveries that contradict their teachings—the persecution of Galileo for advocating heliocentrism is a prime example. Today, we witness similar conflicts in the resistance to teaching evolutionary biology in schools or in the opposition to stem cell research. Additionally, religious doctrines can impede social progress; for instance, resistance based on religious grounds to rights for women and LGBTQ+ individuals prolongs inequality and infringes on human rights.

**3. Indoctrination and Moral Absolutism:**
Lastly, religions often promote a form of moral absolutism that is incompatible with modern, pluralistic societies. This absolutism not only stifles intellectual and moral flexibility but also enforces a narrow worldview that can justify extreme behavior, including terrorism and cultural genocides. On a more personal level, religious indoctrination from a young age can stifle critical thinking and encourage conformity rather than questioning and open-minded exploration of ideas.

**Comparative Impact:**
In a world with less influence from organized religion, we posit that there will be fewer barriers to social and scientific progress. Moral and ethical systems would more likely be based on common humanity and rational consensus rather than unyielding doctrine. This fosters a more inclusive, dynamic society where individuals are valued for their contributions rather than their conformity to religious norms.

In conclusion, while religion undoubtedly has provided personal comfort and community to many, its role as an institutionalized structure within society has recurrently fostered division, hindered progress, and imposed restrictive moral codes. Therefore, based on the evidence and the outcomes, it's clear that religion, on balance, does more harm than good.
