Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed adjudicators, and my esteemed colleagues,

Thank you for joining us today to debate this pressing motion: "This house regrets Trump as a president." As the Opening Government, we strongly stand by this motion and will present a comprehensive case to support it.

First, let me establish a few key definitions and framing to set the stage for our discussion. By "regrets," we mean that we view Trump's presidency as having more negative than positive impacts, particularly in terms of long-term consequences for the United States and the world. When we refer to Trump as "president," we are considering the period from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021, during which he held office and implemented his policies. Our case will revolve around the multifaceted impacts of his presidency, and we argue that these impacts were largely detrimental.

With definitions and framing established, let’s dive into our case. Our argumentation will focus on several key areas: the erosion of democratic norms, increasing polarization, mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental rollbacks, damage to global reputation, increasing socioeconomic inequality, erosion of scientific integrity, undermining civil rights, judicial appointments, and encouragement of extremism.

First, Trump's presidency was characterized by the erosion of democratic norms. Trump's frequent attacks on the press, the judiciary, and the electoral process undermined the foundations of American democracy. For example, his labeling of the media as the "enemy of the people" not only delegitimized the press but also discouraged accountability and free speech. By criticizing judicial decisions that did not favor him, he eroded public confidence in an independent judiciary. These actions pose long-term risks to the stability and functionality of democracy in the United States, fostering an environment where future leaders might feel emboldened to further undermine these institutions.

Second, Trump's administration significantly increased polarization and division within the country. His often inflammatory rhetoric exacerbated racial, political, and social divides, creating a more hostile and fragmented society. For instance, his failure to unequivocally condemn white supremacist groups and his controversial handling of issues like immigration and Black Lives Matter protests amplified societal tensions. This heightened polarization has lasting consequences for national unity and societal cohesion, making it harder for different groups to find common ground and collaborate effectively.

Let’s move on to Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. His inconsistent and often contradictory messages, including downplaying the severity of the virus and promoting unproven treatments, contributed to higher infection and death rates. He resisted mask mandates and prematurely encouraged reopening, which delayed economic recovery and increased public distrust in governmental public health guidance. In comparison, more coherent leadership would likely have led to fewer casualties and a more robust public health response.

Fourth, Trump's administration saw significant rollbacks on environmental regulations designed to combat climate change and protect natural resources. For example, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and rolling back the Clean Power Plan have long-term detrimental impacts on the environment. These actions have hindered progress toward sustainable development and climate goals, putting future generations at greater risk from the effects of climate change.

Fifth, Trump's foreign policy approach, characterized by nationalist and often isolationist rhetoric, damaged America's global standing and relationships with key allies. His "America First" approach led to strained relationships with NATO allies, withdrawal from international agreements, and trade wars with economic partners. This weakened international cooperation on critical issues like climate change, trade, and security, diminishing the United States' influence on the global stage.

Moving to socioeconomic inequality, policies implemented during Trump's administration, such as tax cuts favoring the wealthy and corporations, contributed to increasing inequality. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefitted the top 1% disproportionately, leaving many working and middle-class Americans struggling financially without adequate support. This exacerbated the wealth gap and increased economic disparities, negatively impacting social mobility and economic fairness.

Next, we must consider the erosion of scientific integrity under Trump’s administration. His sidelining of scientific expertise, particularly in areas like climate change and public health, undermined evidence-based policymaking. This not only impaired effective management of pressing issues but also eroded public trust in scientific advisories. For example, promoting unverified treatments for COVID-19 over expert advice endangered public health and safety.

Additionally, Trump’s tenure saw actions and policies that undermined civil rights protections for marginalized groups, such as immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of color. The enactment of policies like the travel ban and the rollback of transgender rights in the military fueled discrimination and social inequality. These actions not only marginalized vulnerable groups but also set back the progress on civil rights significantly.

Moreover, Trump's presidency led to the appointment of multiple conservative judges to the federal judiciary, including three Supreme Court Justices. These lifetime appointments have shifted the ideological balance of the courts, impacting legal decisions on critical issues such as reproductive rights, healthcare, and voting rights for decades. This shift challenges the progress made on various social and legal fronts and sets a conservative tone for future rulings.

Lastly, Trump’s rhetoric and actions often emboldened extremist groups, leading to an increase in hate crimes and domestic terrorism. For instance, his equivocal statements on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville encouraged such groups. This has created a more dangerous and volatile environment within the United States, posing significant risks to public safety and social order.

In conclusion, the detrimental impacts of Trump's presidency are clear and extensive. The erosion of democratic norms, increased polarization, mishandling of the pandemic, environmental rollbacks, damage to global reputation, increasing inequality, compromised scientific integrity, undermining civil rights, conservative judicial appointments, and encouragement of extremism collectively paint a regrettable picture of his tenure. Therefore, we strongly affirm the motion that this house regrets Trump as president.

Thank you.
