Ladies and gentlemen, as we debate the notion that dogs are better than cats, it is crucial we delineate what "better" means in this context. We aren't just talking about personal preferences like fur softness or playfulness, but rather, tangible societal and personal benefits derived from choosing one of these animals over the other.

The argument from this side of the house centers around multiple facets—comprehensively the societal, emotional, physical, and security benefits brought forth by dogs considerably outweigh the benefits offered by cats. This not only enhances individual lives but, structurally, impacts the societal fabric positively.

First, let’s dive into the companionship and emotional support provided by dogs. Unlike cats, which are often seen as more independent and less affectionate, dogs are renowned for their loyalty and ability to form deep, emotional bonds with their owners. This companionship is a substantial mental health booster. Research from psychology journals suggests that the bond formed with dogs can decrease anxiety and depression, promoting a mentally healthier society. This adds a layer of emotional stability to individuals, especially beneficial in the rising tide of mental health issues globally.

Moving on to physical health—the benefits of walking a dog are substantial. Regular walks, necessary for a dog’s health, inadvertently promote physical activity among dog owners which leads to lower rates of obesity and associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular ailments. Here, the true value isn't just in individual health but reduced public health costs, which is paramount in countries grappling with ballooning healthcare expenditures.

On training and adaptability: dogs are highly trainable, not just for basic commands but for roles in security, therapeutic, and assistance settings. Their ability to learn and adapt to various roles like aiding in search-and-rescue operations, assisting law enforcement, and providing support as therapy animals in medical settings is unrivaled. Cats, on the other hand, do not usually exhibit this level of trainability or adaptability to diverse roles that directly benefit societal structures.

Furthermore, in terms of safety and security, dogs provide an unmatched service. Their instinct to protect their pack, which often includes their human family, coupled with their keen senses, makes them excellent deterrents against home invasions or other security risks. The psychological comfort of having a 'guardian' can not be understated, contributing to a feeling of safety which is fundamental for mental well-being.

Let's consider social dynamics. Dogs require outdoor activities and this promotes social interactions among dog walkers. Such interactions foster community spirit and can effectively combat the increasingly concerning loneliness epidemic in many societies. The social catalyst effect of dogs thereby extends beyond the owner and permeates community dynamics.

In therapeutic settings, the calming presence of dogs has been shown to reduce patient recovery times and improve outcomes in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Their influence in such emotionally charged environments is profound and has been leveraged in countless health institutions to alleviate patient suffering.

Turning our focus to individuals with disabilities, the role of service dogs is foundational in enhancing mobility, independence, and quality of life for many. From guiding visually impaired individuals to predicting seizure episodes, dogs contribute indispensably to the lives of vulnerable demographics.

In child development, dogs have been proven to teach responsibility, empathy, and compassion. Their presence in a child's formative years can instill a sense of security and boost self-esteem, crucial components for healthy psychological development.

To encapsulate, the advantages of dogs extend significantly beyond companionship. They ripple out into physical health benefits, enhanced security, stronger community ties, profound therapeutic influences, critical support for disability, and developmental growth in children. These benefits are structurally and emotionally more impactful than those typically offered by cats.

In conclusion, while recognizing the joy cats might also bring into lives, when we measure the comprehensive benefits, it’s evident that dogs have a far more substantial positive impact on both personal and societal levels. Hence, this house believes—based on depth, variety, and magnitude of impact—that dogs are, indeed, better than cats. Thank you.
