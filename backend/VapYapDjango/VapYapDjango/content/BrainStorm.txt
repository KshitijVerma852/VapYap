- Upholding Democratic Values: Granting amnesty to whistleblowers supports the core democratic principles of transparency and accountability. By protecting individuals who expose unethical practices, democratic states reinforce their commitment to these values, distinguishing themselves from non-democratic regimes where such revelations are often suppressed.

- Encouraging Ethical Governance: Amnesty for whistleblowers can deter unethical behavior within the government. Knowing that there are individuals who could expose wrongful acts without fear of retribution might encourage government officials and employees to adhere more strictly to ethical guidelines, ultimately leading to cleaner governance.

- Public Trust and Engagement: When citizens see that whistleblowers are protected rather than punished, their trust in the governmental process is likely to increase. This greater trust can lead to higher civic engagement, as the public feels more confident that the government respects and upholds the law and public interest.

- Prevention of More Serious Crimes: Whistleblowers often expose not just unethical, but also illegal activities. By granting amnesty and encouraging these disclosures, democratic states can prevent or mitigate serious crimes, including corruption and violations of civil rights, that might otherwise have continued unchecked.

- Strengthening the Media and Civil Society: Whistleblowers are important sources of information for investigative journalism and civil society initiatives. By protecting these individuals, states support a robust ecosystem of non-governmental checks and balances, which are vital for a healthy democracy.

- Facilitation of Policy Reforms: Exposures brought about by whistleblowers can serve as catalysts for essential policy reforms. These reforms might not only correct the specific issues highlighted but can also lead to broader improvements in government policies and procedures, enhancing overall government function.

- Contribution to International Standards: By granting amnesty to whistleblowers, democratic states can set a positive example internationally, promoting norms of transparency and accountability in governance worldwide. This could enhance global efforts to combat corruption and increase international cooperation in upholding human rights.

- Protecting Freedom of Speech: Whistleblowing is closely tied to the fundamental right to freedom of expression. Granting amnesty ensures that this right is not curtailed when it comes to speaking out against wrongdoing within the government, thereby reinforcing a key freedom that supports all other democratic rights.

- Mitigating Risk of Escalation: When unethical practices are not exposed or addressed, there is a risk that they will escalate, eventually resulting in more destructive outcomes such as systemic corruption or even state failure. Whistleblowers act as an early warning system, helping to address issues before they escalate.

- Moral and Ethical Responsibility: It is both a moral and ethical duty for democracies to protect those who, often at great personal risk, expose wrongdoings. Granting amnesty not only acknowledges their courage but also aligns with the ethical responsibilities of a state to support justice and fairness.
