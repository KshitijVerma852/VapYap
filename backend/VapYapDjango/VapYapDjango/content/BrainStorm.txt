- Promotion of Transparency: Granting amnesty to whistleblowers would underscore the importance of transparency within government operations. It establishes a norm that values the disclosure of unethical practices, ensuring that officials are held accountable. This can lead to a more open governance model, where citizens are better informed about the actions of their representatives.

- Enhancement of Government Accountability: By providing protection for whistleblowers, democratic states can prevent the suppression and cover-up of corrupt practices. This promotes accountability among government officials, as they are more likely to be cautious in engaging in unethical behavior if they know that employees or insiders could expose such actions without fear of reprisal.

- Deterrent Effect on Government Misconduct: Amnesty for whistleblowers acts as a deterrent against potential misconduct by government officials. Knowing that they could be exposed by protected insiders may discourage unethical practices from the outset, leading to cleaner, more ethical governance.

- Strengthening of Democratic Values: Transparency, accountability, and the protection of law are foundational to democracy. Amnesty for whistleblowers aligns with these values by protecting individuals who take risks to expose wrongdoing. This helps in maintaining public trust in governmental institutions, which is essential for the healthy functioning of a democracy.

- Empowerment of Citizens: Amnesty for whistleblowers empowers citizens by giving them the means to act against governmental malpractice without the fear of severe consequences. This creates a more engaged citizenry, willing to participate in the democratic process and oversight of government.

- Prevention of Potential Abuses and Harm: Whistleblowers often expose situations that could lead to significant harm or abuse, such as misuse of public funds, violations of rights, or risks to public health and safety. By granting amnesty, states can mitigate these risks early, potentially saving resources and lives.

- Positive International Perception: Countries that protect whistleblowers can be viewed more favorably on the international stage. This can enhance their reputation as champions of human rights and democracy, potentially leading to stronger international relations and collaborations.

- Boost to Moral Courage: Knowing that the state supports whistleblowers through amnesty might encourage more individuals to come forward. This not only exposes more unethical practices but also fosters a culture where moral courage is respected and protected.

- Critical in Crisis Situations: In situations of significant governmental wrongdoing or during national crises, whistleblowers play a crucial role in exposing the truth. Amnesty ensures that individuals can come forward with information that may be critical for national wellbeing or security without fear of retaliation.

- Reflection of Public Will: Surveys often show that the public supports protections for whistleblowers. By implementing policies that reflect this will, governments can improve their legitimacy and strengthen the social contract with their citizens.
