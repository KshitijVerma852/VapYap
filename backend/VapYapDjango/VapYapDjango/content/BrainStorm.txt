1. **Promotion of Conflict and Violence**: Many conflicts throughout history and in contemporary times are fueled by religious motivations or are between groups of different religious beliefs. These conflicts can lead to wars, acts of terrorism, and civil unrest, causing widespread suffering and loss of life.

2. **Impediment to Social Progress**: Religion can contribute to societal stagnation by upholding traditional beliefs that oppose modern ideas and reforms, such as gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and scientific progress. For instance, some religious doctrines oppose the teaching of evolution, reproductive rights, and the normalization of same-sex relationships, hindering societal advancement and inclusivity.

3. **Divisiveness in Society**: Religion often segregates communities along doctrinal lines, creating 'in-groups' and 'out-groups,' leading to social exclusion, prejudice, and discrimination. This divisiveness can manifest in significant societal rifts as seen in many multi-faith societies where religious identity is a major determinant of social dynamics.

4. **Justification for Discriminatory Practices**: Religious texts and teachings are sometimes used to justify discriminatory practices, including sexism, racism, casteism, and other forms of social discrimination. Such interpretations can institutionalize inequalities and perpetuate injustice within societies for generations.

5. **Control and Manipulation**: Religion can be utilized as a tool for control and manipulation, with religious leaders sometimes exploiting their authority and influence for personal gain or to serve political agendas. This exploitation can lead to the erosion of individual freedoms and general societal harm.

6. **Economic Costs**: Significant amounts of money are invested in religious institutions and activities (such as constructing lavish places of worship) that could otherwise be channeled into social and economic development projects like education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation. Furthermore, exemptions from taxes granted to religious organizations can also represent a substantial loss of potential public revenue.

7. **Mental Health Issues**: Guilt, fear, and existential angst induced by certain religious beliefs can lead to mental health issues among adherents. The fear of eternal punishment or the anxiety over not living up to religious standards can have profound psychological impacts.

8. **Obstruction to Scientific and Medical Progress**: In some instances, religious institutions have obstructed scientific research and medical advancements. One notable example is the resistance to stem cell research or treatments that are opposed on religious grounds but offer significant potential for curing diseases.

9. **Spread of Misinformation and Superstition**: In regions with strong religious influences, superstitions and myths often replace empirical evidence and scientific reasoning. This can lead to harmful practices like witchcraft accusations, refusal of medical treatments in favor of spiritual healing, and other forms of harm that stem from misinformation.

10. **Cultural Rigidity and Loss of Diversity**: Strong religious identities can lead to cultural rigidity, where there is resistance to cultural exchange and integration. This can stifle creativity, innovation, and appreciation of cultural diversity, instead promoting a homogeneous society that may be less resilient and adaptive to global changes.
