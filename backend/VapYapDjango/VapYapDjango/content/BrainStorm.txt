Here are the potential arguments for the motion "Does religion do more harm than good?" from the perspective of Opening Government:

1. **Promotion of Intolerance and Division**: Many religions preach exclusivity in salvation and truth, which can foster intolerance towards those of different faiths or no faith at all. This can lead to division, discrimination, and even conflict between different religious groups, or between religious and secular communities, undermining social cohesion.

2. **Impediment to Scientific and Social Progress**: In numerous instances, religious doctrines have clashed with scientific advancements and social reforms. For example, resistance to evolutionary theory, stem cell research, or rights for LGBTQ+ individuals. Such resistance can halt or reverse progress in understanding and improving the human condition.

3. **Justification for Violence and War**: Throughout history, religion has been used to justify violence, war, and terrorism. The crusades, jihads, and various religious conflicts have caused immense suffering and loss of life, often sanctified by religious rhetoric.

4. **Oppression and Control**: Religions can enforce strict codes of behavior, often with severe penalties for transgression, which can be particularly oppressive to women and sexual minorities. Examples include restrictions on women's rights, punishment for apostasy, and anti-homosexuality laws.

5. **Exploitation of Believers**: Many religious organizations require financial contributions from followers, which can be exploited by leaders for personal gain. Additionally, some use their influence to manipulate followers' political views or personal decisions.

6. **Stifling Critical Thinking**: By promoting belief without evidence, or even in the face of contradictory evidence, religions can discourage critical thinking and rational decision-making in its adherents. This can perpetuate ignorance and hinder personal and societal growth.

7. **Moral Absolutism**: Religious moral absolutism can deny the complexity and nuance of moral issues, leading to rigid ethical positions that may not be suitable to modern, pluralistic societies. This can result in harsh judgements or unfair treatments of those who do not conform to specific religious moral tenets.

8. **Resource Diversion**: Huge amounts of resources are invested in the construction and maintenance of religious institutions that could otherwise be diverted to socially beneficial projects like education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation.

9. **Psychological Harm**: Fear of divine punishment or eternal damnation can cause significant psychological stress and anxiety. Religions with strict and punitive belief systems can contribute to feelings of guilt, fear, and unworthiness.

10. **Cultural Isolation and Segregation**: Strong religious identities can lead to communities isolating themselves culturally and socially from the broader society, which can hinder cultural exchange and mutual understanding in diverse societies. This segregation can perpetuate ignorance and prejudice on all sides.

These arguments aim to highlight how religion, while having the potential for positive influence, often plays a detrimental role in numerous facets of societal progress and individual well-being, thus arguing that it does more harm than good.
