1. **Environmental Impact**: Planes have a higher carbon footprint per passenger mile compared to cars, especially when considering newer, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Supporting cars promotes environmentally friendly alternatives such as electric vehicles, thus contributing to the fight against climate change.

2. **Flexibility and Accessibility**: Cars offer greater flexibility and accessibility. They allow travelers to reach destinations not served by airports, provide door-to-door service, and facilitate spontaneous or last-minute travel plans—something planes cannot offer due to fixed routes and schedules.

3. **Economic Consideration**: Car travel can be more cost-effective compared to plane travel, especially for short and medium distances. This includes avoiding extra costs such as airline tickets, baggage fees, and airport taxes.

4. **Infrastructure and Convenience**: Airports require extensive infrastructure and are often located outside city centers, necessitating additional travel time to and from the airport. Cars can travel directly to the required destination without the need for such extensive infrastructure.

5. **Privacy and Personal Space**: Traveling by car provides more privacy and personal space compared to planes, which are often cramped and involve close contact with strangers. This can be especially important for families, business travelers, or those looking to travel in comfort.

6. **Safety and Control**: Cars give travelers more control over their journey, including the ability to stop and take breaks when needed. While planes are generally safe, any issues or delays are entirely out of the passengers' control, leading to potential inconvenience and stress.

7. **Local Economic Benefits**: By using cars, travelers are likely to spend money in local communities along the way—fuel, food, lodging, etc., boosting the local economy which is not the case with air travel. 

8. **Health Benefits**: Extended periods of sitting on planes can lead to health issues such as deep vein thrombosis. Car travel allows for frequent stops and movement, contributing to better health during long journeys.

9. **Cultural Preservation**: Traveling by car encourages tourism in less-known areas, preserving cultural heritage and diversifying economic benefits. Small towns and rural areas benefit more from car tourists compared to plane travelers who tend to stick to major cities and popular destinations.

10. **Safety during Pandemics**: In situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, car travel is generally safer than plane travel due to the ability to maintain physical distancing, control the travel environment, and reduce exposure to high-density environments like airports.

11. **Autonomy in Emergencies**: In emergency situations, having a car allows individuals to evacuate and respond quickly without depending on the availability of flights, which may be limited or canceled.

12. **Individual carbon efficiency**: While planes may be more efficient for extensive international travel, for shorter domestic trips, cars can be more fuel-efficient and environmentally benign, especially with the increasing prevalence of hybrid and electric vehicles.
