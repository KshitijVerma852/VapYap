1. **Intolerance and Discrimination**: Many religions often promote exclusionary beliefs that lead to social divisions. These teachings can fuel discrimination against various groups based on religious doctrines, such as against different sexual orientations, gender identities, and even followers of other religions, creating societal rifts.

2. **Violence and Conflict**: Throughout history, religion has been a catalyst for numerous wars and conflicts, often justified by religious texts or doctrines. Examples include the Crusades, various religiously motivated terrorist attacks, and ongoing conflicts in places like the Middle East. This notion supports the argument that religion can escalate conflicts instead of promoting peace.

3. **Impediment to Scientific and Social Progress**: Religion sometimes constrains intellectual advancement and societal progress by opposing scientific discoveries and social reforms that contradict traditional beliefs. For instance, the historical church opposition to heliocentric theory or the contemporary resistance against teaching evolution in schools shows how religious beliefs can hinder educational progress and broader intellectual freedom.

4. **Control and Manipulation of Followers**: Religion can be used as a tool for manipulation, exploiting followers' faith for personal or political gain. This is evident in some religious cults or in how some political figures use religious rhetoric to manipulate electoral outcomes or justify autocratic governance.

5. **Economic Exploitation**: The financial aspect of organized religion often involves substantial wealth, frequently resulting in cases where funds are misappropriated or exploited for personal gain by religious leaders. This can lead to economic disparities and exploitation of believers who donate part of their income to religious organizations.

6. **Indoctrination and Lack of Free Thinking**: From a young age, individuals in many religious communities are indoctrinated with specific beliefs, which can limit critical thinking and personal development. This enforced ideology can discourage questioning and cognitive development in other spheres, fostering a less inquisitive and conformist society.

7. **Moral Rigidity**: Some religions promote extremely rigid moral doctrines that do not adapt well to changes in moral perspectives and social standards. This can lead to harmful practices like shunning or even physical punishment of those who deviate from or challenge these established norms.

8. **Emotional and Psychological Harm**: The fear of eternal punishment or divine retribution can have profound emotional and psychological impacts on individuals, leading to issues like anxiety, guilt, and existential fear, particularly among those who struggle with faith.

9. **Barrier to Unity and Global Cohesion**: The diverse and often conflicting religious beliefs can act as a barrier to global unity and cohesion. In a world increasingly connected by technology and shared global challenges, religious differences continue to provide a robust basis for division and misunderstanding.

10. **Influence on Law and Policy**: In some cases, religious groups have significant influence on laws and policies, which can result in imposition of specific religious norms on entire populations, including those who do not follow the same faith. This undermines the secularism of states and can impede rights such as those related to abortion, marriage, and freedom of expression.
