    -Erosion of Democratic Norms: Trump's presidency was marked by frequent attacks on democratic institutions and norms. His rhetoric and actions often undermined the press, the judiciary, and the electoral process, which can lead to long-term consequences for the stability and functionality of democracy in the United States.

    -Polarization and Division: Trump's administration significantly increased polarization within the country. His often divisive and inflammatory rhetoric exacerbated racial, political, and social divides, creating a more hostile and fragmented society. This has had lasting effects on national unity and social cohesion.

    -Mishandling of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Trump's approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic was widely criticized for being inconsistent and downplaying the severity of the virus. This mishandling likely contributed to higher infection and death rates, as well as delayed economic recovery and increased public distrust in governmental public health guidance.

    -Environmental Rollbacks: During Trump's presidency, there were significant rollbacks on environmental regulations designed to combat climate change and protect natural resources. These actions have detrimental long-term impacts on the environment and hinder progress towards sustainable development and climate goals.

    -Impact on Global Reputation: Trump's foreign policy approach, characterized by nationalist and often isolationist rhetoric, damaged America's global standing and relationships with key allies. This weakened international cooperation on critical issues like climate change, trade, and security, diminishing the United States' influence on the global stage.

    -Increase in Socioeconomic Inequality: Policies implemented during Trump's administration, such as tax cuts favoring the wealthy and corporations, contributed to increasing socioeconomic inequality. These policies exacerbated the wealth gap and left many working and middle-class Americans struggling financially without adequate support and resources.

    -Erosion of Scientific Integrity: Trump's administration was criticized for sidelining scientific expertise and undermining scientific integrity, particularly in areas like climate change and public health. This undermines evidence-based policymaking and can have far-reaching negative consequences for public policy and trust in science.

    -Undermining Civil Rights: Trump's tenure also saw actions and policies that were perceived as undermining civil rights protections, particularly for marginalized groups such as immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of color. This has contributed to increased discrimination and social inequality.

    -Judicial Appointments: Trump's presidency led to the appointment of multiple conservative judges to the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court. These lifetime appointments have shifted the ideological balance of the courts and will impact legal decisions on critical issues such as reproductive rights, healthcare, and voting rights for decades.

    -Encouragement of Extremism: Trump's rhetoric and actions were often seen as encouraging and emboldening extremist groups, leading to an increase in hate crimes and domestic terrorism. This has created a more dangerous and volatile environment within the United States, posing significant risks to public safety and social order.
