Considering the motion, "This house believes that religion does more harm than good," and focusing on arguments for the Opening Government (OG) side of the debate, here are potential arguments you can develop:

1. **Promotion of Intolerance and Division**: Explain how religion has been a catalyst for divisiveness and intolerance, leading to conflicts and violence. You can provide historical examples such as the Crusades, religiously motivated terrorism, or ongoing sectarian violence in various parts of the world. The argument could emphasize how religious identities often supersede other identities, leading to exclusion and even persecution of minorities.

2. **Impediment to Scientific and Social Progress**: Argue that religion can hinder both scientific and social progress. You can discuss historical events where religious institutions suppressed scientific discoveries (e.g., the persecution of Galileo by the Catholic Church). Also, consider the resistance by some religious groups to modern social values concerning gender equality, LGBTQ rights, and family planning, which can impede societal development and human rights.

3. **Control and Manipulation**: Examine how religion has been used as a tool for control, often serving the interests of a powerful few rather than the community. Discuss how this can lead to the exploitation of followers through financial, sexual, or psychological abuse, citing examples like the misuse of funds or the abuse scandals within major religious organizations.

4. **Resource Allocation**: Argument about the extent to which resources are allocated to religious institutions which could otherwise be used to improve education, health, and welfare systems. This includes tax exemptions for religious organizations, which deny governments significant amounts of revenue that could be invested in public services.

5. **Psychological Impact**: Discuss the potential harm religion can do psychologically by inducing fear, guilt, and repression, which can affect mental health adversely. This could be particularly impactful in explaining feelings of guilt and sin related to natural human behaviors, that are often condemned in religious doctrines.

6. **Limits to Personal Freedom**: Outline how religion can impose restrictive codes and practices on individuals, limiting personal freedom and autonomy. This can span various life choices including dietary restrictions, dress codes, career choices, or sexual freedom, all governed by religious doctrines rather than personal or secular ethics.

7. **Obstruction to Global Unity**: Illustrate how religion can be a barrier to global unity and cooperation. Differing religious beliefs can interfere with diplomatic relations and cooperation on global issues like climate change, human rights, and peacebuilding efforts. 

These arguments should be substantiated with both historical and contemporary examples, theoretical frameworks about ethics and human rights, and statistical evidence where applicable to create a compelling case.
