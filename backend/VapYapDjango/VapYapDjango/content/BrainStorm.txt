- Upholding Freedom of Speech and Transparency: Granting amnesty to whistleblowers who expose unethical practices enhances freedom of speech and transparency in governance. It encourages individuals within the government to come forward with information that can lead to reforms and better compliance with ethical standards, ultimately benefiting the public and strengthening democratic accountability.

- Strengthening Democracy: Democracies thrive on checks and balances, and whistleblowers serve as an essential check on governmental power. By exposing corruption and unethical behavior, they help prevent the misuse of power and uphold democratic principles. Granting amnesty would protect these vital actors from reprisal, promoting a healthier democratic environment.

- Encouraging Ethical Governance: Amnesty for whistleblowers would set a precedent that emphasizes the importance of ethics in government. It signals to public officials that unethical behavior will not be tolerated and that they are accountable to the populace. This can deter potential misconduct, leading to cleaner, more effective governance.

- Restoring Public Trust in Government: Public trust is crucial for the effective functioning of a democracy. When whistleblowers expose corruption and are subsequently protected by amnesty, it reassures the public that the government is committed to transparency and accountability, thereby restoring and strengthening trust in public institutions.

- Preventing Potential Abuses and Harm: Whistleblowers often expose practices that could be harmful to the publicâ€”such as breaches of safety standards, misuse of public funds, or violations of civil rights. Granting amnesty ensures that individuals can report these issues without fear of retribution, potentially preventing harm and safeguarding public interests.

- International Best Practices: Many democratic nations and international bodies advocate for and protect whistleblowers through various legal mechanisms, recognizing their role in a functioning democracy. Adopting amnesty could align a state with these international norms and best practices, contributing to a global culture of transparency and ethical governance.

- Reducing Costly Legal Battles: Legal proceedings involving whistleblowers who face retaliation or criminal charges can be lengthy and costly. By granting amnesty, states can reduce these legal costs and instead focus resources on investigating and rectifying the unethical practices that were exposed.

- Support for Internal Reform: Whistleblowers often highlight areas within government agencies that require reform. By granting amnesty and valuing their disclosures, governments can more readily identify and implement necessary reforms, leading to more efficient and responsive governance.

- Empowering Citizens: Granting amnesty to whistleblowers empowers citizens by validating their role in overseeing and improving government. It fosters a culture where people feel more vested in their government and more comfortable in holding it accountable, reinforcing democratic values.

- Resolving Issues Internally: When whistleblowers believe that they have protections, such as amnesty, they may be more likely to first seek internal resolution of unethical practices. This can lead to faster and more discreet handling of sensitive issues, avoiding public scandals and maintaining governmental integrity.
