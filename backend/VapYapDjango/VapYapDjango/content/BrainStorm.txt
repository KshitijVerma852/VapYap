1. **Intolerance and Division**: Religion can often be a source of division and intolerance within and between societies. Different religious beliefs can lead to segregation in social, educational, and professional settings, fostering environments where prejudice and discrimination can thrive. These divisions can escalate into conflict and violence, as seen in numerous historical and ongoing religious conflicts around the world.

2. **Impediment to Scientific and Social Progress**: Throughout history, religious doctrines have frequently been at odds with scientific discovery and progress. For example, the historical opposition to the theory of evolution and the heliocentric theory of the solar system. This conflict can hinder educational systems and contribute to societies that devalue critical thinking and empirical evidence, potentially delaying technological and social advancements.

3. **Gender Inequality and Discrimination**: Many religions promote traditional gender roles and have doctrines that limit the roles and rights of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. This can lead to systemic discrimination, reduced economic and social opportunities for these groups, and perpetuation of practices that violate human rights, such as forced marriages and honor-based violence.

4. **Justification for Violence and War**: Religious ideologies have been used to justify violence, terrorism, and wars. Whether as a central motive or as a tool for rallying support, religion can be exploited to legitimize the use of violence, leading to large-scale human suffering and conflict.

5. **Suppression of Individual Freedoms**: Religions often impose strict codes of behavior and morality that can suppress individual freedoms and human rights. Blasphemy laws, for instance, which exist in several countries, can lead to censorship, imprisonment, or even death for those who criticize religious beliefs or practice freedom of expression.

6. **Economic Exploitation**: The financial aspect of organized religion often goes unchecked, where religious institutions amass significant wealth, sometimes at the expense of economically disadvantaged believers who contribute a portion of their limited income through tithes or donations, expecting spiritual or material rewards.

7. **Moral and Ethical Control**: Religious morality is often absolute and unyielding, leaving little room for moral and ethical pluralism or evolution. This can stifle debate and moral reasoning in complex issues like euthanasia, abortion, and using stem cells for research and treatment, where rigid religious doctrines may conflict with ethical considerations aimed at reducing suffering or enhancing quality of life.

8. **Impact on Health**: Certain religious beliefs can negatively impact public health. Resistance to medical procedures like vaccinations, blood transfusions, and contraceptive use due to religious beliefs can lead to preventable outbreaks of diseases, increased maternal and child mortality rates, and obstruct the fight against population growth and sexually transmitted diseases.

9. **Psychological Harm**: The fear of eternal punishment or damnation and the concept of original sin can have strong negative psychological impacts, especially on children. This can lead to feelings of guilt, fear, and low self-esteem that might persist into adulthood.

10. **Resistance to Secular Policies**: Religion's influence in politics can lead to resistance against secular policies designed to enhance societal welfare. Issues such as marriage equality, abortion rights, and stem cell research see significant opposition almost purely on religious grounds, often impeding policy development that is based on collective human rights and scientific advancement.
