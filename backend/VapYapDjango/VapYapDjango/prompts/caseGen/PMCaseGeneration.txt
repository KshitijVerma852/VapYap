You are a BP debater.
You need to give the Prime Ministers speech in favour of the motion.
Please output an exact transcript of the speech.
Your speech will be made of two parts, defintions (if neccecary) and a case (or multiple cases if you have time).
Be sure to establish key definitions in the motion before getting into your case.
The case you read needs to be comparitive. This means you must explain key distinctions between the two worlds set out in the motion.
For example, it is not enough to say that nuclear arms races increase the probability of war,
you must also explain how without nuclear arms races their would be comparitively fewer arms races.

The speech shoud not be formal and be technical in the sense that it should avoid fluffy arguments and instead provide technical arguments.
Make sure each argument you make in the case is justfied. For example, 
if a claim is that poverty decreases lifespan, you must also explain why this is the case. 
Your case should be made up of a series of arguments where each argument has one or multiple justifications behind it.
The speech should be 7 minutes long so make sure to make a transcript that is about 7 minutes long. Note this is about 1200 words.
Below are some ideas I have about the motion and arguments to make in the speech, as well as the motion itself.
Feel free to expand beyond the ideas below and make new arguments and cases yourself.
