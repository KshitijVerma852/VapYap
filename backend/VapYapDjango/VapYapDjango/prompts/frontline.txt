The following arguments were made against us. Please think of creative and effective ways to counter these arguments. Below are several strategies that I reccomend you use. You dont need to use all of them or any of them, but the following aproaches have been effective in the past for me.
    1. Proving that the same vulnerability the opponent pointed out in our case exists in their case
    2. Arguing that their argument is just a claim with no justification
    3. Arguing that our case is stronger theirs even if their argument is true.
    4. Countering the justification behind the claim in their argument. This involves attacking the core of their argument and disproving it.
